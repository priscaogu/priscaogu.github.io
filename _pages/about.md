 A data scientist with a systematic approach to problem-solving, and a keen interest in predictive analytics. Driven by the idea of digital transformation and its impact on enhancing business efficiency.

I am intrigued by patterns and enjoy connecting the dots with data. My journey into data analytics began after years of nurturing young minds in the education sector. I am deeply passionate about mentoring and empowering individuals to harness the full potential of technology.
