 A data scientist with a systematic approach to problem-solving, and a keen interest in predictive analytics. Driven by the idea of digital transformation and its impact on enhancing business efficiency.

### I am intrigued by patterns and enjoy connecting the dots with data. My journey into data analytics began after years of nurturing young minds in the education sector. I am deeply passionate about mentoring and empowering individuals to harness the full potential of technology. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `photo.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
